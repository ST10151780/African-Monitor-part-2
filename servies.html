      <h2>1. Data Follow-Up & Review</h2>
      <p>
        African Monitor’s initiative improves the observation and assessment of the 2030 Agenda by producing 
        prompt, youth-driven data on important indicators. Their main project, 
        <strong>Voice Africa’s Future (VAF)</strong>, enables young people in seven African nations—Botswana, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, Uganda, and Zambia—
        to participate in data gathering, analysis, and advocacy for development accountability.

      <h2>2. Promoting Sustainable Development in Africa</h2>
      <p>
        This initiative aims to hasten the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Agenda 2063. It promotes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The incorporation of development objectives into national policies and budgeting processes.</li>
        <li>The establishment of multi-stakeholder engagement platforms throughout Africa.</li>
        <li>Giving precedence to marginalized groups and addressing areas such as education, skills, economic opportunities, governance, and poverty reduction—while also integrating gender equality and youth development into all aspects.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Service 3 -->
    <div class="service-card">
      <h2>3. Development Finance & Partnerships</h2>
      <p>African Monitor focuses on two interconnected areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Illicit Financial Flows (IFF):</strong> Their goal is to minimize illicit financial outflows—particularly in South Africa—by enhancing understanding and advocacy. This includes consolidating research, simplifying messages, educating civil society, and engaging with policy-makers to promote systemic reforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Development Support Monitor (DSM):</strong> This long-term initiative monitors and evaluates the commitments of African governments and development partners regarding development funding. DSM acts as an accountability mechanism by analyzing how well funding aligns with grassroots delivery over time.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Service 4 -->
    <div class="service-card">
      <h2>4. Building the Capacity of African Civil Society</h2>
      <p>
        African Monitor assists the <strong>Africa CSO Working Group (AWG)</strong>, a collaborative network of close to 200 civil society organizations. 
        Serving as the AWG’s secretariat, they offer both financial backing and strategic guidance to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enhance the impact of African civil society on regional and global policies.</li>
        <li>Develop knowledge and creative policy tools influenced by grassroots needs.</li>
        <li>Fortify CSO networks and leadership for responsible and sustainable development.</li>
      </ul>
