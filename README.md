# African-Monitor-part-2 updates

**1. Responsive Design**

Implemented media queries to handle different screen sizes:

Desktop (default)

Tablet (max-width: 1024px)

Mobile (max-width: 768px)

Adjusted layout for smaller screens:

Navigation links stack vertically on mobile.

Cards in services and main sections switch from multi-column to single-column layout.

Gallery images stack in one column on small screens.

**2. Hero Section Update**

Added a hero/banner section on the home page with a background image and overlay text.

Fixed the background image so it doesnâ€™t take up all the space and maintains aspect ratio.

Added semi-transparent overlay behind text for better readability.

**3. Relative Units**

Replaced pixel-based font sizes and spacing with rem units for scalable and consistent layout across devices.

Padding and margin adjustments made relative to font size.

**4. Responsive Images**

Images in gallery, hero section, and about pages optimized for responsive design.

Used object-fit: cover to ensure images maintain aspect ratio and fit their containers without distortion.

5. Navigation & UI Improvements

Sticky navigation bar ensures menu remains visible on scroll.

Navigation links and buttons are sized appropriately for touch devices.

Hover effects maintained for desktop and removed/adjusted for mobile.

**6. Layout & Styling**

All cards (main, services, gallery) now have consistent padding, spacing, and border-radius.

Shadows added for better depth and visual appeal.

Content areas use semi-transparent backgrounds to improve readability against background images.
